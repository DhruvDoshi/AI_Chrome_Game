## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is the game developed with google which will help to recreate the iconic no internet connection game on the chrome. The code will automatize the bird and learn from the models and at the end it will achieve high scores in the range of 2k-3k.

This is developed with help of processing language p5.js please visit its officaial website for more information.
The p5js.org website contains an extensive overview of the project, community, documentation, and examples. If you already know the basics of JavaScript or Processing, the p5.js overview wiki page is a good place to start.

To get the complete p5.js library on your own computer, you can download it here. If you are interested in the most recent, less stable version, or even simply in (new!) certain components of p5.js, you can clone this repository and run grunt from the command line to generate the library from source. See the contributor docs for more information about our build process.
